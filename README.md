  - Due Date : **11:59pm, Friday 9th September**.


## Aim

Reveal similarities and differences between the United States and Australia Census Data, based on

* _Australian Bureau of Statistics_ (ABS) 2021 Census.

#### Ruberic: 
#### Context and Data \(20%\)

- Adequate context has been provided to understand the question and why it is important.
- The question \(or hypothesis\) you seek to understand is clearly stated.
- What data is used and its provenance. Instructions allow the reader to easily source the data.
- Relevant differences between the data from different sources, and assumptions you have to make for comparison, are clearly described.

#### Data lifecycle, structure, and presentation (20%)

- Explain
  - The route from the data to the results 
  - What format the raw data took
  - Any data cleaning and conversion
  - Analysis necessary to extract and compile the results

#### Results, Visualisation and Conclusion \(20%\)

- The results are clearly stated and connected back to the original data and assumptions.
- Appropriate choices are made for visualisation\(s\) \(plots\) and are clearly and professionally presented..
- Conclusions are connected to relevant features of the visualisations.

#### Coding \(20%\)

- Code is _clear_, easy to read and comprehend. Considerations should include:
  - meaningful variable names
  - Comments and/or docstrings for key steps/blocks
  - functions
- Aim for:
  - _concise_: Code should not be pared down to a bare minimum at the expense of clarity and readability.
  - _efficient_: Avoid unnecessary inefficiencies.
  - _structured_: Functional decomposition is used to separate tasks into meaningful components.

#### Professionalism and Challenge \(20%\)

- Overall the report forms a compelling narrative.
  - not unnecessarily long or repetitive and provides all the information in a complete, concise way.
  - reveals aspects of the data that are not trivially obvious.
  - Quality that an employer would be comfortable showing to a client.
